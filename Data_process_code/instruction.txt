##########      Here is the explanation of the functionality of the files in this folder "Data_process_code"   #############

In this folder, we have several files to process the data from ACCESS-S2(path: /g/data/ux62/access-s2/hindcast/raw_model/atmos/pr/daily/e01/).
 The process steps include crop and interpolation and output to the desired output directory.
 


Use qsub command to submit the .sh file to execute .py files.

Here are some Explanations of the code, please refer to the emerging place in the processing code(.py file)

# In VDSR preprocessing, the Australian territory is 111.975 <= lon <= 156.275    - 44.525 <= lat <= - 9.975. Use Xarray read the data, you will get a 'pr' value of (lat:62, lon:54)
# In VDSR preprocessing, 澳大利亚领土的范围是 111.975 <= lon <= 156.275    - 44.525 <= lat <= - 9.975，用xarray读取后会得到 'pr' 值 coords为(lat:62, lon:54)
# Be noticed, the longtitude is in the first dimension and lat is in the second
#  size = (81,93) when n = 1.5
[2]
# combine the new lat and the new lon
# meshgrid will produce two dimension matrices which size is a * b
# The corresponding coordinates of these two matrices can generate a combined value
# Ex. x = [1,2,3,4] y = [7,8,9]
# X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
# X = [[1, 2, 3, 4],
#     [1, 2, 3, 4],
#     [1, 2, 3, 4]]
# Y = [[7, 7, 7, 7],
#     [8, 8, 8, 8],
#     [9, 9, 9, 9]]

The final output is the xarray with lat, lon, time three dimensions and the 

patch larger impact, directly influence the location information.  batch
RCAN 192 * 192 
ESRGAN 128 * 128 (much better than VDSR 2 years ago) 
DESRGAN batch size smaller patch larger(part of inter plot)

700 * 700

There are different number in different ensembles
e01-e03 has 6811 files respectively
e04-e09 has 2736 files respectively
That is due the different number of initial dates in different ensembles. Therefore, in the subsequent process,
we need to use the .nc files of the common dates to train and test.
